  <strong>Aksum</strong>, located in Tigray, Ethiopia, is one of Africaâ€™s most important <em>ancient cities</em>.
  It was the heart of the <strong>Aksumite Kingdom</strong>, a powerful civilization known for <em>trade</em>,<br>
  <em>culture</em>, and its <em>monumental stone obelisks</em>. In the 4th century, Ethiopia peacefully accepted <strong>Christianity</strong>, long before many European nations. Later, in the 7th century,<br> Aksum also welcomed the first Muslims during the <em>Hijra</em>, showing the <strong>hospitality </strong>and <strong>tolerance</strong> of its people.
